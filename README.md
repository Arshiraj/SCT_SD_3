# SCT_SD_3
#  Sudoku Solver in C++

This project is a **Sudoku solver** written in C++ using **backtracking algorithm**. It takes a 9x9 Sudoku grid as input with empty cells represented by `0`, and solves the puzzle if a valid solution exists.

---

## âœ… Features

- Solves standard 9x9 Sudoku puzzles
- Uses backtracking algorithm for recursive solution
- Clean console output of both input and solved Sudoku grids

---

## ðŸ“‚ Files

- `sudoku_solver.cpp` â€“ Main source code file
- You can run this file with any C++ compiler like `g++`.

---

## ðŸ§  How It Works

1. The `solveSudoku()` function tries to fill empty cells with numbers from 1 to 9.
2. For each number, it checks if placing it is safe:
   - Not already in the same row
   - Not already in the same column
   - Not already in the 3x3 subgrid
3. If a valid number is found, it fills the cell and recursively tries to solve the rest of the grid.
4. If stuck, it backtracks and tries the next number.
